# Private Key Management

Private keys are the foundation of cryptocurrency security. Losing or exposing them means losing your funds.

## Key Principles

### Never Share Your Private Key

- Private keys should never be shared with anyone
- Legitimate services will never ask for your private key
- Be wary of phishing attempts

### Secure Storage

- **Hardware wallets**: Most secure for long-term storage
- **Paper wallets**: Offline storage option (handle carefully)
- **Encrypted storage**: If storing digitally, use strong encryption

### Backup Strategies

- Create multiple secure backups
- Store backups in different physical locations
- Test recovery procedures
- Use seed phrases for wallet recovery

## Common Mistakes

- Storing keys in plain text
- Taking screenshots of private keys
- Sending keys via email or messaging
- Using weak passwords for encrypted wallets
- Not backing up seed phrases

## Best Practices

1. Use hardware wallets for significant amounts
2. Generate keys using secure random number generators
3. Never reuse private keys
4. Rotate keys periodically if possible
5. Use multi-signature wallets for shared accounts
